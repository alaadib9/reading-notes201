HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

Choosing Images for Your Site :
Images should:
1) Be relevant
2) Convey information
3) Convey the right mood
4) Be instantly recognisable
5) Fit the color palette

Aligning Images:
### left
This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).
### right
This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).

### top
This aligns the first line of the
surrounding text with the top of
the image.
### middle
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
### bottom
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.

Three Rules for creating Images:
1) Save images in the right format
2) Save images at the right size
3) Use the correct resolution
### Image Dimensions
Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
 Color pickers can help you find the color you want

 The width, height, and style attributes are all valid in HTML.
