from my reads 
I learned that Debugging is the name of the process which programmers use in order to find errors , and there are practical tips to use :
try to explain the problem to anyone so i can figure out the solution .

trying the code in another browser may be beneficial since some problems are browser-related.

commenting the code out using /* Anything between these
characters is a comment */ or removing parts of the code and strip it down .

simply using traditional search such as google Or using Stack Overflow which is a  Q & A site for programmers .

using online validation tools such as 
http://www.jslint.com
http:// www.jsonlint.com
and also ther is a jQuery debugger plugin could be found in Chrome web store.

Also I read about common erorrs might found , so the issues we can check to figure out errors:
check capitalization .
check that double / single quotes properly matched .
in the Html check that id attributes values are unique.
semicolon should be at the end of every statment.
check if there are missing closing braces or parentheses .
And also there are issues related to data type such as 
Using= rather than == will assign
a value to a variable, not check
that the values match.
