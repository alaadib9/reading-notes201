* HTML list *

HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain −

<ul> − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

<ol> − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.

<dl> − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.

HTML Ordered Lists
If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered list will be used. This list is created by using <ol> tag. The numbering starts at one and is incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with <li>.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Ordered List</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <ol>
         <li>Home </li>
         <li> Contact us </li>
         <li>about us</li>
      </ol>
   </body>
	
</html>

This will produce the following result:
1.Home
2.Contact us
3.about us 


The type Attribute
<ol type = "I">
Example :
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

   <head>
      <title>HTML Ordered List</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <ol type = "I">
         <li>butter</li>
         <li>Ginger</li>
      </ol>
   </body>

</html>
This will produce the following result:
I.butter
II.Ginger

The CSS Box Model:
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 
1) Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2) Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3) Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4) Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

Flow Chart :
Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or functions are executed. In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till the last line unless of course in the code there is some instructions or statements that changes that control flow.
The most known control flow used I would think is the if statement that we used many of our code.
