What is localStorage?
localStorage allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser with no expiration date. The data will not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available when the browser is opened again.

JavaScript localStorage methods
There are four basic JavaScript methods you can use to access and work with localStorage:

setItem() - takes a key-value pair and adds it to localStorage
getItem() - takes a key and returns the corresponding value
removeItem() - takes a key and removes the corresponding key-value pair
clear() - clears localStorage (for the domain)

Local storage - data with no expiration date that will persist after the browser window is closed.

The easiest way to use localStorage is to treat it like a regular object
