### Object 
WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables
The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
objectName.propertyName
An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string.


### DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.
The DOM is called an object model because the model (the DOM tree) is made of objects.

The opening tags of HTML elements can carry attributes and these are represented by attribute nodes in the DOM tree
