Chart.js
How to create a chart in JS?
Getting started with Chart.js is easy. The script included on your page along with a single <canvas> node to make the chart is all that is needed.
Step 1: Find the element by selector (id/tagname/classname etc) like document.getElementById
Step 2: Find the element .element(document.getElementById(<id>))
Step 3: Find scope so that we can access application internals.
