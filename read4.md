HTML Table:
An HTML table consists of one <table> element and one or more <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements.

The <tr> element defines a table row, the <th> element defines a table header, and the <td> element defines a table cell.

A simple HTML table, containing two columns and two rows:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firt Name </th>
    <th>Last Name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alaa</td>
    <td>dib</td>
  </tr>
</table>

 ** CSS layout **
<div> elements are also used to contain elements in order to group parts of a page together. 
Unless you indicate relative, absolute or fixed positioning, browsers view pages in natural flow.
The float property transfers content to the page's left or right and can be used to create templates for multiple columns. (Defined width is required for floated items.)
You may use fixed width or liquid (stretchy) formats for pages.
CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
