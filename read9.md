### HTML Forms

HTML forms give you a set of elements to collect data from
your users
An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons. 
There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site:
1 ) ADDING TEXT: Text input (single-line) Used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names
2 ) Password input:Like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.
3 ) Text area (multi-line) :For longer areas of text, such as messages and comments
4 ) Checkboxes When a user can select and unselect one or more options.
#### How Forms Work
1 )A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
2) The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
3) The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
4 )The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

#### Form Structure
The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.
type="text"
When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input.
